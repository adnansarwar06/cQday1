Demo script for File System Tools integration with the agent.

This script demonstrates the agent's ability to:
1. List files in the knowledge_base directory
2. Read existing files
3. Create new files in the output directory
4. Edit existing files
5. Perform multi-step file operations using ReAct reasoning

Run this script with the backend server running:
    uvicorn main:app --reload

Then run this script:
    python test_file_tools_agent.py
