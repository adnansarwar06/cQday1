Case Study Summary: MKM - Future-Proofing Business with Bloomreach AI-Powered Composable Commerce

MKM is the largest independent builder's merchant in the UK, serving B2B, B2C, and B2B2C customers with over 100 branches and 2,500 employees. Facing challenges with an aging tech stack and a website that did not reflect its stellar in-branch experience, MKM partnered with Bloomreach alongside Vue Storefront, BigCommerce, and Brave Bison to modernize its digital presence.

Using the Bloomreach Commerce Experience Cloud—comprising Bloomreach Content, Engagement, and Autonomous Search—MKM implemented a composable commerce architecture that enabled hyper-personalized and localized experiences tailored to unique customer segments across different locations.

Within just four weeks of going live, MKM experienced:
- 7.9% increase in average order value (AOV)
- 43% increase in total web revenue
- 77% increase in average time spent on site
- 39% year-over-year increase in site traffic
- 75% improvement in average page load speed
- 27% increase in total web orders

MKM's digital transformation empowered the company to replicate its excellent in-branch customer service online, deliver personalized experiences, and optimize operational efficiency, positioning it strongly for the evolving market landscape.

This case study exemplifies how Bloomreach's AI-driven marketing automation, intelligent search, and unified content management drive tangible, rapid business results for complex multichannel commerce businesses.
